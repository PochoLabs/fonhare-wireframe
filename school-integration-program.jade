			h1 School Integration Program
			p FONHARE has established a School Integration Program.  Through this program, FONHARE changes lives by granting impoverished children living with physical disabilities a free scholarship for their education.  We also build ramps and adapt the school to their physical requirements.  In Haiti, education is not free.  Therefore, many children living in poverty will not get an education, but especially those living with a disability.  The need for children with disabilities to be represented in the educational setting is tremendous.  We believe that the way to break down barriers is to start with the young and establish a sense of equality in the beginning of oneâ€™s life.  The School Integration Program serves to do just that by integrating students into the educational system and working for equality by advocating for them and helping to create an environment of mutual respect and acceptance.  
			p The focus of the School Integration Program is two-fold.  First, we must work with educators and families to accept students with disabilities into their environment and curriculum.  We must advocate for their rights in order to prove their value, potential, and need for an education so they may become contributing citizens.  Secondly, we must work to make their educational setting accessible by modifying the school as necessary.  We build wheelchair ramps where needed, provide accessible and adaptable equipment, and teach those involved in how to make the educational environment accessible for all.
