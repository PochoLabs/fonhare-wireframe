			h1 Rehabilitation Program
			p The Rehabilitation Program is set up for the provision of physical therapy and occupational therapy services in a clinic setting.  FONHARE also arranges home visits to treat patients who are not able to leave their home in order to come to the clinic, provides transportation to the clinic if needed, and provides home assessments for accessibility concerns (see INDEPENDENT LIFE PROGRAM).  Patients seen at FONHARE include children and adolescents born with developmental disabilities, stroke victims, orthopedic injuries and deformities, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injury, people with pain and dysfunction, and neurological conditions.  In the past, FONHARE received children from the local orphanage for therapy sessions and worked closely with the orphanage to provide environmental recommendations for them.  Most recently, FONHARE has implemented a Speech Therapy program. Volunteer speech therapists from France have spent significant time training FONHARE nursing staff to provide speech therapy sessions for our patients, following the prescribed plan of care.  Without FONHAREâ€™s help, thousands would not receive any rehabilitative care or assistance with their activities of daily living.  Many would simply survive with a disability, instead of engage in any meaningful existence.
